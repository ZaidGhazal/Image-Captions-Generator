# Introduction

In this project, scripts are provided to download data from the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home) and train a CNN-RNN model for automatically generating image captions. Also inference can be made to predict an input image captions.

# How to Run
- Install requirements/CONDA env
- run the dataset download
- Run the training script
- Use inference.py to predict choosen images captions


# Tech Description
There are important implemented functionalilties in this project to be explained:

- In the `data_loader.py`, the function `get_loader()` works on creating a data loader for the training/test set files to generate batches consisting of images and the corresponding captions. 
- In the `model.py`, the `EncoderCNN` involves transfer learning from the pre-trained ResNet50 neural netowrk to achive excellent features extraction. As usual, the last fully connected layer was removed and a new layer was added instead to be trained on the COCO images and generate the desired word embbiding vector.
- The `DecoderRNN` architcture involves using the LSTM units to generate the captions. This netork takes the generated word embbiding vector from the `EncoderCNN` as input and predict the captions accordingly.
